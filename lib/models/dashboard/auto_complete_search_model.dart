For certain specialised works, such as prestressed concrete and certain items of precast concrete requiring consistently high strength concrete, the use of 53 grade OPC is found very useful. 53 grade OPC produces higher-grade concrete at very economical cement content.

As per BIS requirements the minimum 28 days compressive strength of 53 Grade OPC should not be less than 53 MPa. For certain specialised works, such as prestressed concrete and certain items of precast concrete requiring consistently high strength concrete, the use of 53 grade OPC is found very useful. 53 grade OPC produces higher-grade concrete at very economical cement content. In concrete mix design, for concrete M-20 and above grades a saving of 8 to 10 % of cement may be achieved with the use of 53 grade OPC.</p>\n","is_on_sale":false,"sale_price":""}]
